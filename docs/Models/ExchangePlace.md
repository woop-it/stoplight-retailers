# Exchange place

A collection point called `exchangePlace` represents a physical collection point directly attached to a store.

The collection point specifies the nature of the location and some information about the collection address. Parameters, configurations and specifications depend on the store.

The configuration entered on the platform is as follows:

- The retailer is contracted with a number of carriers and sets up its stores in its name.
- The store adopts the configuration and features of the carriers for its retailer.
- The store can adjust the configuration of its existing carriers.
- The store then configures a set of collection points (where the products are physically collected) on its behalf.
- Each collection point inherits the configuration and features of the carriers for its store.
- At this stage the collection point can also adjust the configuration of its existing carriers.

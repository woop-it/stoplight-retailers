# To begin

To begin, all technical information about Woop APIs for carriers is contained in this documentation. For any questions or clarification, please contact the internal technical team.

To use the APIs, you will need the login information you received when you created your account on the platform.


This document is divided into 2 sections illustrating the exchanges possible between Woop and the brand:
- `Brand to Woop` (retailer_to_woop.v1.4.0.json): Which describes the overall operation of the API response from the brand to Woop. This section describes functions such as creating a delivery order and retrieving a list of relay points.

- `Woop to Brand` (woop_to_retailer.v1.1.0.json): Which describes the overall operation of the API (response) from Woop to the Brand. These APIs allow Woop to provide the necessary information to the brand. Functions such as updating delivery status and choosing a carrier are described in this section.

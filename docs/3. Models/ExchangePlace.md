The configuration established within the platform is the following : 
- The retailer contracts with a group of carriers and configures its stores. 
- Each store inherits the configuration and characteristics of the carriers of its retailer. 
- On its own command, the store can refine the configuration of its inherited carriers. 
- Then the store configures a group of exchange places. 
- Each exchange place inherits the configuration and characteristics of the carriers of its store. 
- At this point, the exchange place can refine the configuration of its inherited carriers.

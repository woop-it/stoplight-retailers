# Changelog 1.15 -> 1.16

Changes between version 1.15 and version 1.16 are listed here.

## Order states

### Add new item in list of possible order states

New order.state = ORDER_WITHOUT_SHIPMENT 

| States                  | Title                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ORDER_TO_BE_COMPLETED` | Order awaiting further information. Request to be completed. |
| `ORDER_WITHOUT_SHIPMENT` | Order without carrier charter. Orders in this status are received with delivery information only.|

## POST /orders input

### Improvement to the order.state component

When declaring an order, it will now be possible to send additional information depending on the status of the order (order.state). 

The general idea is to provide information specific to the delivery in the creation request for state = ORDER_WITHOUT_SHIPMENT. 

<!--
type: tab
title: Versions up to 1.15.0
-->

```json
{
  "state": "ORDER_TO_BE_COMPLETED"
}
```
<!--
type: tab
title: From version 1.16.0
-->
```json
{
  "code": "ORDER_WITHOUT_SHIPMENT",
  "options": {
    "deliveryId": "A234D4F",
    "parcelIds": [
      "12345",
      "94554J"
    ]
  }
}
```
<!-- type: tab-end -->

This information will be used for the tracking of the delivery.

# Changelog 1.14 -> 1.15

Changes between version 1.14 and version 1.15 are listed here.

## POST /orders input

### Add the fields required for the customs declaration 

For international deliveries, it is necessary to set up a customs declaration for shipments from France.

The order creation method now authorises new fields enabling a customs declaration to be drawn up correctly. 

Note the changes to the packages.products object and the addition of a notion of purchase invoice linked to the sales order.
